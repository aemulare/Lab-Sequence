# Sequence

Model of an sequence of items (int, float, double, char, strings) and operations with them.

## Project Assignment

> Implement a container class called a sequence. The items contained in a sequence are arranged one after the other, unlike a bag, which implies an unorganized arrangement of items. 
> The class should include member functions to allow a program to step through a sequence 
> one item at a time, as well as member functions to control exactly where items are inserted 
> and removed in the sequence. 
> The class should include a data member that keeps track of the “current item” in the sequence
> and member functions to set the current item to the beginning of the sequence 
> and to advance the current item.
